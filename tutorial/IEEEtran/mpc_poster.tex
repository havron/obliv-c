\begin{abstract}

A \emph{Secure multi-party computation} (MPC) protocol allows two or
more parties to compute a function on sensitive input data provided by
both parties, without revealing anything about the inputs (other than
what can be inferred from the revealed output result).  Social
scientists often work with private datasets that cannot be shared due to
legal restrictions and ownership issues, but many interesting studies
could be enabled if MPC allows joint data analyses on private data
analysis. We are exploring opportunities for using MPC to enable
scientific research that would not otherwise be possible.  We have
developed tools and libraries that enable joint scientific data analyses
with private data, and report on preliminary results using MPC to enable
linear regression analyses over private data.

\section{Introduction}

Many social scientists and researchers need to perform statistical
analyses across large, independently-owned datasets for their work, but
they are often met with difficulties in obtaining sensitive data and
computing results in a safe manner.  For instance, an education
researcher may be interested in using statistical methods to analyze the
relationship between family income and grade point average for a
particular school system or collection of school systems.  Obtaining
such sensitive data is often difficult to do without trusting one or
more parties with some of the private input data, as well as considering
ownership and legal restrictions on having clear access to private data.
One government agency has information about incomes, but cannot share it
without violating regulations (and compromising privacy); a local school
district has information about students' grades, but cannot correlate
that with their family incomes.  Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is
a protocol which can be used as a tool for carrying out large-scale
scientific data analysis in these situations without compromising the
privacy of any party's data, or risking it being exposed.

\section{Approach}

Several approaches to MPC have been developed, including
application-specific custom protocols and generic, universal techniques
that can be used to compute any function privately.  We use universal
techniques since it is important that new functions can be developed
quickly and without needing new security proofs, and we anticipate
needing to incorporate auditing and other functionality into the MPC.
The most common universal MPC techniques are based on secret sharing,
homomorphic encryption, and garbled boolean circuits using Yao's
protocol.  We use garbled circuits, which are generally the most
scalable and high performance MPC approach currently known.

Obliv-C (\url{http://oblivc.org}) is a programming language which allows
an application developer to quickly implement scalable, secure MPC
protocols, using the languageâ€™s API or writing specific functionality by
extending the language's existing library as well as experimenting with
the implementation of library protocols\cite{cryptoeprint:2015:1153}.
Obliv-C provides an implementation of Yao's garbled circuit protocol for
use with semi-honest adversaries, although it can also be used to
implement other protocols.  The language is compiled and built on top of
the standard C language, allowing for developers to integrate C tools
and libraries with Obliv-C seamlessly.  This is important for our goals,
since we want the programming required to build an MPC protocol to be as
little as possible, while allowing programmers to integrate existing
tools and libraries.

An excerpt of Obliv-C code which calculates and reveals the correlation
coefficient of a linear regression is below:

\begin{verbatim}
   obliv int orsqr = getOblivRSquared();
   revealOblivInt(&io -> rsqr,orsqr,0);
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
The \tt{obliv} qualifier built into Obliv-C's type system ensures the
variable used is encrypted with the garbled circuit
scheme\cite{cryptoeprint:2015:1153}. In this case, the variable is the
correlation coefficient of linear regression analysis, obtained through
some function call to a method within the MPC protocol. The result is
revealed to specified parties through the API \tt{revealOblivInt()},
which works by cooperatively decrypting the encrypted value into a
normal C struct.  Revealing an integer stores the result into a struct
which is accessible to specified parties ("0" means all parties in this
context).

\section{Preliminary Results}
\subsection{Scalability}
A linear regression data analysis program was developed to test the scalability 
and speed of Obliv-C as a tool for implementing MPC programs. 
Testing was done using c4.large \emph{Elastic Compute Cloud} (EC2) nodes from \emph{Amazon Web Services} (AWS)\cite{aws:ec2}, which feature 
high frequency Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 (Haswell) processors optimized specifically for EC2,
two vCPUs, and 3.75 GiB of DRAM.
Two c4.large instances were launched and connected through 
Obliv-C's API for TCP/IP connections via Oblivious Transfer protocol. The instances 
were both located in the same cloud cluster in Oregon; exploring network latency 
impositions with secure MPCs is also an area of interest.

One node instance provided independent ($x$) data points, while the other provided 
dependent ($y$) data points; data points used were 32-bit integers, using fixed-point 
mathematics to convert raw data values into scaled integers, as 
Obliv-C does not currently support floating point numbers.
The time needed to execute the MPC between instances appears to scale linearly 
with the size of the data input; 100K data points finished execution in 12.7 minutes 
on average, 500K completed in 63.7 minutes, and 1 million data points finished execution 
in just over 127 minutes on average. Given the relative cost of using a c4.large instance
(as of writing, \$0.105 per hour), executing this program over larger inputs, such as
10 million data points, will only incur about \$4.45 between two instances in the 
estimated runtime of 21 hours.

Artificial data was generated for testing the scalability of input size, and
considerations to automated data match-ups between two separate datasets were not
implemented; the artifical data was presumed to already be matched and sorted properly.
To provide a clear example of the utility of Obliv-C for analyzing sensitive datasets, 
additional data for computation was obtained from the public New York State Department 
of Health dataset of Hospital Inpatient Discharges from 2011\cite{healthdata:ny}. 
Comparisons between fields such as "Length of Days stayed" and "Total Costs" 
over approximately 2.6 million data points are currently being tested.
This dataset is particularly amenable to analysis, as all data is already 
matched properly and each data value is a comparable number.

\subsection{Discussion}
All numbers are averages over 5 executions between c4.large instances. The datasets used in Preliminary Results assume that data is matched, sorted, and 
comprises of comparable values. Using private set intersection to assist matching 
data with a unique identifier and automatically filtering out incompatible 
data points is considered for future work. The proposed health dataset is
publicly available and in a single database. A more realistic situation would be 
for the independent and dependent data points to be each residing in separate 
datasets, owned by different organizations, and being tied to legal restrictions 
for sharing the data.


\section{Related Work}
A similar approach in taking distinct federal datasets and comparing them is seen in
Dan Bogdanov \emph{et al.}, where correlations between working hours and failure to
graduate on time in Estonia was investigated, matching over 10 million 
tax records and 500K education records\cite{cryptoeprint:2015:1159}.
This analysis utilized the researchers' own framework for secure
computation, \emph{ShareMind}, a database and analytics system which 
almost exclusively uses three-parties to carry out computations, and uses arithmetic
manipulations to implement secure MPC, rather than boolean circuit evaluation\cite{sharemind}.

Another privacy-preserving approach to analyzing millions of records uses a
combination of homomorphic encryption (for linear computations) and Yao circuits 
(for non-linear computations) in order to compute ridge regression\cite{ridgeregression}.
This approach is designed for many users to send data to a central server called the 
\emph{Evaluator}, in contrast to the primarily two-party model presented in the Obliv-C
language. Yet another approach used for secure multiple linear regression 
relies on protocols based on homomorphic secret sharing, and data which is partitioned 
across several databases\cite{secretsharing}.
 
\section{Conclusion}
Using MPCs for scientific analysis of large datasets is promising for social scientists
and researchers whom would otherwise need to reveal some of one party's input to another
party in order to analyze their data or be unable to perform analysis due to legal restrictions and ownership issues. 
The Obliv-C language is particularly well-suited for implementing such scalable, 
sensitive data analysis between two or more parties, and shows the practicality of 
using secure MPCs for processing large datasets.
Future work invites a closer examination of automatic data-matching between
separate datasets with private set intersection, improving fixed-point integer 
conversion for decimal data values used in computation, and other privacy-preserving
applications.
